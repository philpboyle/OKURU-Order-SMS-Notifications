# Admins can notify their customers about the following order statuses

1. Order placement (order confirmation)
2. Refund request
3. Order cancellation
4. Abandoned cart
5. Shipment
6. Product delivery
7. Product review request
8. Other promotional bulk messages.

As we discussed at the beginning of the article, the process and act of effective communication is one of the most important reasons behind every successful business. Providing customers with every detail about their order at every step, from order placement to order delivery, eliminates their need to go through your websiteâ€™s order tracking page, which not only saves their time but also enhances their post-shopping experience with your Shopify store.
